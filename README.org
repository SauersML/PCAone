* Introduction

PCAone is a fast and memory efficient PCA tool implemented in C++
aiming at providing comprehensive features and algorithms for
different scenarios. PCAone implements 3 fast PCA algorithms for
finding the top eigenvectors of large datasets, which are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnoldi_iteration][Implicitly
Restarted Arnoldi Method]] (IRAM, --svd 0), [[https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/468][single pass Randomized SVD]]
but with power iteration scheme (RSVD, --svd 1, Algorithm1 in paper)
and *our own RSVD with window based power iteration scheme*
(PCAone, --svd 2, Algorithm2 in paper). All have both in-core and
out-of-core implementation. Addtionally, full SVD (--svd 3) is
supported via in-core mode only. There is also an [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/PCAoneR][R]] package
here. PCAone supports multiple different input formats, such as [[https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats#bed][PLINK]],
[[https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format][BGEN]], [[http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Input#Beagle_format][Beagle]] genetic data formats and a general comma separated CSV
format for other data, such as scRNAs and bulk RNAs. For genetics
data, PCAone also implements [[https://github.com/Rosemeis/emu][EMU]] and [[https://github.com/Rosemeis/pcangsd][PCAngsd]] algorithm for data with
missingness and uncertainty. The PDF manual can be downloaded [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/PCAone/blob/main/PCAone.pdf][here]].

wget $pkg
unzip -o PCAone-avx2-Linux.zip
wget http://popgen.dk/zilong/datahub/pca/example.tar.gz
tar -xzf example.tar.gz && rm -f example.tar.gz
# in default calculating top 10 PCs with in-memory mode 
./PCAone -b example/plink
R -s -e 'd=read.table("pcaone.eigvecs2", h=F);

** Download PCAone

For most modern CPUs and Linux systems, download the one named with =avx2=.

#+begin_src shell
pkg=https://github.com/Zilong-Li/PCAone/releases/latest/download/PCAone-avx2-Linux.zip
wget $pkg || curl -LO $pkg
unzip -o PCAone-avx2-Linux.zip
#+end_src

If the server is too old to support =avx2= instruction, download the alternative version.

#+begin_src shell
pkg=https://github.com/Zilong-Li/PCAone/releases/latest/download/PCAone-x64-Linux.zip
wget $pkg || curl -LO $pkg
unzip -o PCAone-x64-Linux.zip
#+end_src

** Download example dataset

#+begin_src shell
pkg=http://popgen.dk/zilong/datahub/pca/example.tar.gz
wget $pkg || curl -LO $pkg
tar -xzf example.tar.gz && rm -f example.tar.gz
#+end_src

You should find a fold named =example= with some example data.

* Installation

There are 3 ways to install PCAone.

** Download compiled binary

There are compiled binaries provided for both Linux and Mac platform. Check
[[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/PCAone/releases][the releases page]] to download one.

** Via Conda

PCAone is also available from [[https://anaconda.org/bioconda/pcaone][bioconda]].

#+begin_src sh
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda install pcaone
PCAone --help
#+end_src

** Build from source

=PCAone= can be running on a normal computer/laptop with =x86-64= instruction
set architecture. =PCAone= has been tested on both =Linux= and =MacOS= system. To
build PCAone from the source code, the following dependencies are required:

- GCC/Clang compiler with C++11 support
- GNU make
- zlib

We *recommend* building the software from source with MKL as backend to
maximize the performance. For MacOS users, we recommend using =llvm= by =brew
install llvm= instead of the default =clang= shipped with MacOS. Check out the
[[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/PCAone/blob/dev/.github/workflows/mac.yml#L21][mac workflow]].

*** With MKL or OpenBLAS as backend

Build PCAone dynamically with MKL can maximize the performance since the
faster threading layer =libiomp5= will be linked at runtime. One can obtain
the MKL by one of the following option:

- install =mkl= by conda

#+begin_src sh
conda install -c conda-forge -c anaconda -y mkl mkl-include intel-openmp
git clone https://github.com/Zilong-Li/PCAone.git
cd PCAone
# if mkl is installed by conda then use ${CONDA_PREFIX} as mklroot
make -j4 MKLROOT=${CONDA_PREFIX}
./PCAone -h
#+end_src

- download =mkl= from [[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html][the website]]

After having =mkl= installed, find the =mkl= root path and replace the path
below with your own.

#+begin_src shell
# if libiomp5 is not in the mklroot path, please link it to $MKLROOT/lib folder
make -j4 MKLROOT=/path/to/mklroot
#+end_src

Alternatively, for advanced user, modify variables directly in =Makefile=
and run =make= to use MKL or OpenBlas as backend.

*** Without MKL or OpenBLAS dependency

If you don't want any optimized math library as backend, just run:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/Zilong-Li/PCAone.git
cd PCAone
make -j4
./PCAone -h
#+end_src

If this doesn't work because the server is too outdated, run =make clean && make -j4 AVX=0= instead.

** Which SVD method to use

This depends on your datasets, particularlly the relationship between number
of samples (=N=) and the number of variants / features (=M=) and the top PCs
(=k=). Here is an overview and the recommendation.

|--------------------------+-----------+----------------------|
| Method                   | Accuracy  | Scenario             |
|--------------------------+-----------+----------------------|
| IRAM (-d 0)              | Very high | =N < 1000=             |
| Window-Based RSVD (-d 2) | Very high | =M > 1,000,000=        |
| RSVD   (-d 1)            | High      | accuracy insensitive |
| Full SVD     (-d 3)      | Exact     | cost insensitive     |
|--------------------------+-----------+----------------------|

** Input formats

PCAone is designed to be extensible to accept many different formats.
Currently, PCAone can work with SNP major genetic formats to study
population structure. such as [[https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats#bed][PLINK]], [[https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format][BGEN]] and [[http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Input#Beagle_format][Beagle]]. Also, PCAone supports
a comma delimited CSV format compressed by zstd, which is useful for other
datasets requiring specific normalization such as single cell RNAs data.

** Output formats
*** Eigen vectors

Eigen vectors are saved in file with suffix =.eigvecs=. Each row represents
a sample and each col represents a PC.

*** Eigen values

Eigen values are saved in file with suffix =.eigvals=. Each row represents
the eigenvalue of corresponding PC.

*** Features loadings

Features Loadings are saved in file with suffix =.loadings=. Each row
represents a feature and each column represents a corresponding PC. Use
=--printv= option to print it.

*** Variants infomation

A plink-like bim file named with =.mbim= is used to store the variants list
with extra infomation. Currently, the =mbim= file has 7 columns with the 7th
being the allele frequency. And PCAone only outputs this file whenever it's
necessary to downstrean analyses.

*** LD matrix

The matrix for calculating the ancestry-adjusted LD is saved in a file
with suffix =.residuals=, and its associated variants information is
stored in =mbim= file. For the binary file, the first
4-bytes stores the number of variants/SNPs, and the second 4-bytes stores
the number of samples in the matrix. Then, the rest of the file is a
sequence of *M* blocks of *N x 4* bytes each, where *M* is the number of
variants and *N* is the number of samples. The first block corresponds to
the first marker in the =.mbim= file, etc.

*** LD r2

The LD r2 for pairwise SNPs within a window can be outputted to a file
with suffix =ld.gz= via =--print-r2= option. This file uses the same format
as the one [[https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/ld#r][plink]] used.

** Memory-efficient modes

PCAone has both *in-core* and *out-of-core* mode for 3 different partial SVD
algorithms, which are IRAM (=--svd 0=), Yu+Halko RSVD (=--svd 1=) and PCAone
window-based RSVD (=--svd 2=). Also, PCAone supports full SVD (=--svd 3=) but
with only *in-core* mode. Therefore, there are *7* ways for doing PCA in PCAone.
In default PCAone uses *in-core* mode with =--memory 0=, which is the fastest
way to do calculation. However, in case the server runs out of memory with
=in-core= mode, the user can trigger =out-of-core mode= by specifying the amount
of memory using =--memory= option with a value greater than 0.

*** Run PCAone window-based RSVD method (default) with in-core mode
#+begin_src shell
./PCAone --bfile example/plink
#+end_src
*** Run PCAone window-based RSVD method (default) with out-of-core mode
#+begin_src shell
./PCAone --bfile example/plink -m 2
#+end_src
*** Run Yu+Halko RSVD method with in-core mode
#+begin_src shell
./PCAone --bfile example/plink --svd 1
#+end_src
*** Run Yu+Halko RSVD method with out-of-core mode
#+begin_src shell
./PCAone --bfile example/plink --svd 1 -m 2
#+end_src
*** Run IRAM method with in-core mode
#+begin_src shell
./PCAone --bfile example/plink --svd 0 -m 2
#+end_src
*** Run IRAM method with out-of-core mode
#+begin_src shell
./PCAone --bfile example/plink --svd 0 -m 2
#+end_src
*** Run Full SVD method with in-core mode
#+begin_src shell
./PCAone --bfile example/plink --svd 3
#+end_src

** Data Normalization

PCAone will automatically apply the standard normalization for genetic data.
Additionally, there are 3 different normalization method implemented with
=--scale= option.

- 0: do just centering by substracting the mean
- 1: do log transformation (usually for count data, such as bulk RNA-seq data)
- 2: do count per median log transformation (usually for single cell RNA-seq data)
  
One should choose proper normalization method for specific type of data.

** Ancestry-Adjusted LD matrix

LD patterns vary across diverse ancestry and structured groups, and
conventional LD statistics, e.g. the implementation in =plink --ld=, failed to
model the LD in admixed populations. Thus, we can use the so-called
ancestry-adjusted LD statistics to account for population structure in
LD. See our [[https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.02.592187][paper]] for more details.

To calculate the ancestry-adjusted LD matrix, we first figure out the number
of principal components (=-k/--pc=) that capture population structure. In this
example, assuming that 3 PCs can accout for population structure, we enable
=--ld= option to calculate and output the ancestry adjusted LD matrix in a
file with suffix =.residuals=.

#+begin_src shell
./PCAone -b example/plink -k 3 --ld -o adj
#+end_src

** Report LD statistics

Currently, the LD r2 for pairwise SNPs within a window can be outputted via =--print-r2= option.

#+begin_src shell
./PCAone -B adj.residuals \
         --match-bim adj.mbim \
         --ld-bp 1000000 \
         --print-r2 \
         -o adj
#+end_src


** Prunning based on Ancestry-Adjusted LD

Given the LD binary file =.residuals= and its associated variant file
=.mbim=, we can do pruning based on user-defined thresholds and windows

#+begin_src shell
./PCAone -B adj.residuals \
         --match-bim adj.mbim \
         --ld-r2 0.8 \
         --ld-bp 1000000 \
         -o adj
#+end_src

** Clumping based on Ancestry-Adjusted LD

Likewise, we can do clumping based on the Ancestry-Adjusted LD matrix and
user-defined association results

#+begin_src shell
./PCAone -B adj_ld.residuals \
         --match-bim adj.mbim \
         --clump example/plink.pheno0.assoc,example/plink.pheno1.assoc  \
         --clump-p1 0.05 \
         --clump-p2 0.01 \
         --clump-r2 0.1 \
         --clump-bp 10000000 \
         -o adj
#+end_src

* More tutorials

Let's download the example data first if you haven't done so.

#+begin_src shell
wget http://popgen.dk/zilong/datahub/pca/example.tar.gz
tar -xzf example.tar.gz && rm -f example.tar.gz
#+end_src

** Genotype data (PLINK)

We want to compute the top 40 PCs for this genotype dataset using 20
threads and only 2 GBs memory. We will use the proposed window-based RSVD
algorithm with default setting =--svd 2=.

#+begin_src shell
./PCAone --bfile example/plink -k 40 -m 2 -n 20
#+end_src

Then, we can make a PCA plot in R.
#+begin_src R
pcs <- read.table("pcaone.eigvecs2",h=F)
plot(pcs[,1:2+2], col=factor(pcs[,1]), xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")
legend("topright", legend=unique(pcs[,1]), col=1:4, pch = 21, cex=1.2)
#+end_src

** Genotype dosage (BGEN)

Imputation tools usually generate the genotype probabilities or dosages in
BGEN format. To do PCA with the imputed genotype probabilities, we can
work on BGEN file with =--bgen= option instead.

#+begin_src shell
./PCAone --bgen example/test.bgen -k 10 -n 4 -m 2
#+end_src

Then, we can make a PCA plot in R.

#+begin_src R
pcs <- read.table("pcaone.eigvecs",h=F)
pop <- read.table("example/plink.fam",h=F)[,1]
plot(pcs[,1:2], col=factor(pop), xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")
legend("topright", legend=unique(pop), col=factor(unique(pop)), pch = 21, cex=1.2)

** Single cell RNA-seq data (CSV)

In this example, we run PCA for the single cell RNAs-seq data using a
different input format with a normalization method called count per median
log transformation (CPMED).

#+begin_src shell
./PCAone --csv example/BrainSpinalCord.csv.zst -k 10 -n 20 -m 4 --scale 2 --svd 1
#+end_src

It should take around 5 minutes.
