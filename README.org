- Quite fast with multi-threading support using high performance library [[https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onemkl.html#gs.8jsfgz][MKL]] or [[https://www.openblas.net/][OpenBLAS]] as backend.
- Supports the [[https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats#bed][PLINK]], [[https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format][BGEN]], [[http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Input#Beagle_format][Beagle]] genetic data formats.

* Installation

** Via conda

If you have conda installed, you can simply run the following command, which will download the MKL dependency for you and fix the runtime library automatically.

#+begin_src sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zilong-Li/PCAone/main/install.sh)"
#+end_src

** Download binaries

There are compiled binaries provided for both Mac and Linux platform. Check [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/PCAone/releases][the releases page]] to download them. *Note* that packages named with =iomp5= need runtime library =libiomp5= to be found in your environment =LD_LIBRARY_PATH=, which can speedup further. If you really need it, You can install the lib by =conda install mkl=.

** Build from source

If you don't want to use MKL of OpenBlas as backends, you can just copy and paste the following code in the terminal without modifying anything. 
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/Zilong-Li/PCAone.git
# modify variables in Makefile to use MKL or OpenBlas as backend
cd PCAone
make
#+end_src
Since the default compilation is without external MKL or OpenBLAS support, you need to set the =MKLROOT= or =OPENBLAS_ROOT= in *Makefile* to your own path to use one of them as backend. If it complains that there is no =lapack= lib, please install it and set the =LAPACK_ROOT= to the correct path as well. 

*IMPORTANT:* Only =GNU GCC= compiler is supported because MKL threading doesn't support =clang= at the moment. For mac users, you need to make sure the default compiler is =GNU gcc= instead of =clang= by doing the following steps before running =make= command.
#+begin_src shell
brew install gcc
export CC=$(find $(brew --prefix)/bin/ -name "gcc-[0-9]*" | tail -1)
export CXX=$(find $(brew --prefix)/bin/ -name "g++-[0-9]*" | tail -1)
#+end_src

* Documentation
** PCA algorithms

PCAone implements 3 fast PCA algorithms for finding the top eigenvectors of large datasets, which are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnoldi_iteration][Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method]] (IRAM), [[https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/468][single pass Randomized SVD]] (RSVD) and our own fancy RSVD method with window based power iterations. Specifically, for genetics data, PCAone also implements [[https://github.com/Rosemeis/emu][EMU]] and [[https://github.com/Rosemeis/pcangsd][PCAngsd]] algorithm.

** Input formats

PCAone is designed to be extensible to accept many different formats. Currently, PCAone can work with SNP major genetic formats to study population structure. such as [[https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats#bed][PLINK]], [[https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format][BGEN]] and [[http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/Input#Beagle_format][Beagle]]. In addition, PCAone also supports a general csv format compressed by zstd assuming the data is already normalized by the users, which is useful for other datasets requiring specific normalization such as single cell RNAs data.

** Output files

- eigen vectors :: eigen vectors are saved in file with suffix =.eigvecs=. each row represents a sample and each col represents a PC.
- eigen values :: eigen values are saved in file with suffix =.eigvals=. each row represents the eigenvalue of corresponding PC.
- loadings :: loadings are saved in file with suffix =.loadings=. need to use =--printv= option.

** Options

- -h :: use normal RSVD algorithm.
- -f :: use fancy RSVD algorithm in PCAone's paper.
- --bands :: number of bands used by fancy RSVD algorithm. must be =2^x=.
- --cpmed :: normalize values by count per median (CPMED) for scRNAs. use this if the input is raw counts.
- --maxp :: maximum number of iterations for RSVD algorithm.
- --printv :: print out another eigenvectors or loadings.
- --shuffle :: shuffle the input data first for fancy RSVD algorithm, use it together with =-f=.

** Running mode

PCAone has both in-core and out-of-core mode for each algorithm. In default, PCAone will load all data in memory, which is the fastest way to do calculation. However, it is usually not feasible to keep the whole large matrix in memory. In contrast, PCAone allows user to specify the amount of memory using =-m= option .

** Examples

- use *Default IRAM* algorithm for small or medium datasets
#+begin_src shell
# running in RAM
PCAone --bfile input.plink -k 20 -n 20 -o out
# running out of RAM, only use 2GB memory
PCAone --bfile input.plink -k 20 -n 20 -o out -m 2
# for csv format compressed by zstd
PCAone --csv input.csv.zstd -k 20 -n 20 -o out -m 2
#+end_src

- use normal RSVD method for large datasets
#+begin_src shell
# running in RAM
PCAone --bfile input.plink -k 20 -n 20 -o out -h
# running out of RAM using  only 2GB memory
PCAone --bfile input.plink -k 20 -n 20 -o out -h -m 2
#+end_src

- use fancy RSVD method for crazy huge datasets
#+begin_src shell
# running in RAM
PCAone --bfile input.plink -k 20 -n 20 -o out -f --shuffle
# running out of RAM using  only 2GB memory
PCAone --bfile input.plink -k 20 -n 20 -o out -f --shuffle -m 2
#+end_src

- running EMU with super fancy RSVD method
#+begin_src shell
PCAone --bfile input.plink -k 20 -n 20 -o out -f --emu -m 2
#+end_src

- running PCAngsd with fancy RSVD method
#+begin_src shell
PCAone --beagle input.bgl.gz -k 20 -n 20 -o out -f --pcangsd
#+end_src
